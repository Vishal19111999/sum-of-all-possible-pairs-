Find the sum of all possible pairs in an array of N elements
Given an array arr[] of N integers, the task is to find the sum of all the pairs possible from the given array. Note that,

(arr[i], arr[i]) is also considered as a valid pair.
(arr[i], arr[j]) and (arr[j], arr[i]) are considered as two different pairs.
Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 2}
Output: 12
All valid pairs are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1) and (2, 2).
1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 12
